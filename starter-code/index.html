          The Lindy hop is an American dance which was born in Harlem, New York
          City, in 1928 and has evolved since then with the jazz music of that
          time. It was very popular during the swing era of the late 1930s and
          early 1940s. Lindy was a fusion of many dances that preceded it or
          were popular during its development. It is characterized by twists,
          turns, and open-position movement.

          The Charleston is a dance named for the harbor city of Charleston,
          South Carolina. It has a characteristic beat. While the dance probably
          came from the African - American dance called Juba, it was probably
          newly devised for popular appeal. At first it involved a simple and
          rythmical twisting of the feet in a lazy sort of way. When the dance
          hit Harlem, a new version was added. It became a fast kicking step.
          Further changes were undoubtedly made before the dance was put on
          stage.

          The Balboa is a swing dance that originated in Southern California
          during the 1920s (though it may have started as early as 1915) and
          enjoyed huge popularity during the 1930s and 1940s. The term Balboa
          originally referred to a dance characterized by its close embrace and
          full body connection. It emphasizes rhythmic weight shifts and
          lead-follow partnership. Because of its emphasis on subtlety and
          partnering rather than flashy tricks, Pure Balboa is considered more
          of a "dancer's dance" than a "spectator's dance".
